alpha: The angle of attack, which is the angle between the chord line of an airfoil and the relative wind. It is typically measured in degrees.

beta: The sideslip angle, which is the angle between the aircraft's longitudinal axis and the relative wind. It is typically measured in degrees.

pb/2V: The rolling velocity, which is the rate of change of the aircraft's roll angle. It is typically expressed in units of radians per second.

qc/2V: The pitching velocity, which is the rate of change of the aircraft's pitch angle. It is typically expressed in units of radians per second.

rb/2V: The yawing velocity, which is the rate of change of the aircraft's yaw angle. It is typically expressed in units of radians per second.

CL: The coefficient of lift, which is a dimensionless parameter that represents the lift generated by an airfoil or aircraft. It is typically expressed as a ratio of the lift to the dynamic pressure and the wing area.

CDo: The coefficient of drag, which is a dimensionless parameter that represents the drag generated by an airfoil or aircraft in the absence of lift. It is typically expressed as a ratio of the drag to the dynamic pressure and the wing area.

bank: The angle of an aircraft's roll axis relative to the horizontal plane. It is typically measured in degrees.

elevation: The vertical position of an aircraft relative to a reference level, such as mean sea level. It is typically measured in units of feet or meters.

heading: The direction in which an aircraft is pointed, typically measured in degrees relative to true north or magnetic north.

Mach: The aircraft's speed relative to the speed of sound, typically expressed as a decimal fraction.

velocity: The aircraft's speed relative to the surrounding air, typically measured in units of knots, miles per hour, or meters per second.

density: The mass per unit volume of the air through which the aircraft is flying, typically expressed in units of kilograms per cubic meter or slugs per cubic foot.

grav.acc.: The acceleration due to gravity, typically expressed in units of meters per second squared or feet per second squared.

turn_rad: The radius of a turn, typically expressed in units of feet or meters.

load_fac.: The load factor, which is the ratio of the total force acting on an aircraft to the aircraft's weight. It is a dimensionless parameter that represents the degree to which the aircraft is being subjected to forces in excess of its weight.

X_cg, Y_cg, Z_cg: The location of the aircraft's center of gravity in the x, y, and z directions, respectively, typically measured in units of feet or meters relative to a reference point.

mass: The total mass of the aircraft, typically expressed in units of kilograms or pounds.

Ixx, Iyy, Izz, Ixy, Iyz, Izx: The components of the aircraft's moment of inertia tensor, which describes the aircraft's resistance to changes in its rotational motion about its three principal axes.

visc CL_a: The derivative of the coefficient of lift with respect to angle of attack in the presence of viscous forces. It is a dimensionless parameter that represents the aircraft's aerodynamic stability.

visc CL_u: The derivative of the coefficient of lift with respect to forward velocity in the presence of viscous forces. It is a dimensionless parameter that represents the aircraft's lift efficiency.

visc CM_a: The derivative of the coefficient of pitching moment with respect to angle of attack in the presence of viscous forces. It is a dimensionless parameter that represents the aircraft's
